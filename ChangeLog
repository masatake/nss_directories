* src/generic.c: don't refer to freed memory in getXXent_r.

* src/generic.c: clear pointers when we free them so that apps which call our
  end.... functions again don't cause us to double-free

* src/generic.c: fix calls to line_parse() so that we don't set pointers in
  returned structures to point to memory we're about to free.

* configure.ac: use more compiler warnings if we're using gcc
* src/parsers.h:  declare external parsers so that everything agrees on their
  signatures.

* src/files-parse.c, src/glibc-parse.c: add glibc-based parsing internally
* src/passwd.c,src/services.c,src/group.c,src/protocols.c,src/shadow.c: use
  the new parsing code
* src/generic.c (setent): return SUCCESS on successful open, not UNAVAIL
* src/Makefile.am: export only _nss_directories_[sge]*, to export the setent,
  getent/getby, and endent functions, but not the parsers.
